# Prima Veritas Kernel

## What This Kernel Is For

Operational records often don’t line up cleanly: logs arrive out of order, entries are duplicated,
timestamps drift, and different parties retain different versions of the same history.

The Prima Veritas Kernel exists to reconstruct a single, defensible sequence of events from records
that already exist, without interpretation or judgment. It establishes what happened in a form that
independent parties can replay and verify.

This kernel is used for post-incident reconstruction, audits, compliance review, and dispute
resolution—situations where clarity matters after the fact, not prediction or analysis.

## Kernel Overview

This repository contains the deterministic replay kernel and the public proof datasets for the
Prima Veritas system.

All kernel code is designed to produce bit-for-bit identical outputs across machines, environments,
and executions.

The kernel provides:

- deterministic ingest
- canonical normalization
- structural event extraction
- ordered hash-chain ledgers
- deterministic replay

No interpretation, heuristics, or conclusions are generated by the kernel.
All interpretation must occur outside the kernel.

Repository Layout

The complete, authoritative system map lives in:

SYSTEM_MAP.md

This file is normative and defines the canonical structure of the repo.

Key areas:

00_SYSTEM — kernel constants + shared utilities

01_INGEST → 05_REPLAY — deterministic pipeline

06_INVARIANTS — declarative rules

07_ERRORS — deterministic kernel error types

08_CLI — thin operator-surface commands

10_DATASETS — public proof datasets (NON-KERNEL)

90_CASEWORK_REPORTS — citation-safe canonical artifacts

See KERNEL_CHARTER.md for full invariants and permitted operations.

Running a Dataset

Datasets live under:

10_DATASETS/<dataset_name>/


Each dataset includes a local run.mjs script.

To materialize a dataset:

node run.mjs


This produces:

atoms.json

ledger.json

expected_hash.txt

Verifying a dataset
node 08_CLI/pv_verify.mjs <dataset_path>


If the final hash matches, the dataset is a valid kernel proof.

Canonical Artifacts

Citation-safe artifacts reside in:

90_CASEWORK_REPORTS/

These include:

baseline court replay

adversarial ordering replay

cross-case delta analysis

These files may be referenced externally but never modified.

Non-Canonical Components

The following are NOT kernel:

datasets (10_DATASETS/)

support tools (94_TOOLS/)

illustrative examples (basic_case/, input/)

translation documents (if created)

They may change freely and do not affect kernel guarantees.
